## Style Guidelines

### Coding Style

We follow a customized coding style for the `PyFileHandling` project, which is a blend of our own conventions and some elements from the [PEP 8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) style guide. The goal is to maintain a codebase that is not only functional but also readable and consistent.

### Key Points:

1. **Consistency is Key:**
   - While we're not strictly adhering to PEP 8, it's important to maintain consistency in coding style across the project.
   - Consistent styling enhances code readability and makes collaboration smoother.

2. **Clear and Concise Comments:**
   - Write comments that explain the purpose of your code. Consider them as notes for your future self and other contributors.
   - Aim for clarity and conciseness in your comments.

3. **Meaningful Naming:**
   - Use descriptive variable and function names. A well-named variable is often better than a comment explaining its purpose.
   - Meaningful names contribute to the project's maintainability.

### Contribution Guidelines:

1. **Pull Requests:**
   - When submitting pull requests, ensure that your code aligns with the established coding style.
   - Mention any deliberate deviations from the style and provide reasons for the changes.

2. **Code Review:**
   - Code reviews will consider both functionality and adherence to the coding style.
   - Be open to feedback and discussions about coding style during the review process.

By following these style guidelines, we aim to create a codebase that is not only functional but also accessible and enjoyable for everyone involved.
